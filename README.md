# StudentManagementWebsite
Basic CRUD Website (tornado,cherrypy, sqlite)
The Create and Delete modules of the website are working fine.
Just a basic project to demonstrate the use of cherrypy using sqlite.
To browse the database file, please download a DB Browser.

There are still some modules which needs to be fixed.
1. Update Student still needs a fix.
2. Linking the login page to the overal website.
